# Quiz_Web_App
A quiz app is a software application designed to provide users with a way to test their knowledge on a specific topic or set of topics. The app would typically offer a series of questions with multiple-choice answers, and users would be able to select their answer and submit it for grading.

A quiz app can be designed to cover a wide range of topics, such as history, science, literature, or pop culture. The app can be tailored to different skill levels, from beginner to expert, and may offer different types of questions, including true/false, multiple-choice.![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93877167/236894594-24ec8b0a-5db5-4468-81fa-a2f9eb357640.png)
